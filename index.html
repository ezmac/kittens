    <h1>Kittens code</h1>
    <p>
      There's this game called <a href="http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/#"> Kittens game.</a>  Yeah, this is code to automate that.  Why?  It seemed like fun to automate it.  It's single player only, so it doesn't matter.  It was good practice in javascript.

    <p>
      to use, hit ctrl shift I (command shift I on mac) and paste this into the console there.  Read the script first if you're paranoid.

     var s = document.createElement('script');s.src="http://ezmac.github.io/kittens/kitties_reloaded.js";s.type="text/javascript";document.body.appendChild(s); 
      </code>

    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>I wanted to "hack" it as much as possible, I tried to stay outside the game's code whenever possible.  I tried to stay out of the game's code, reverse engineering where I had to.  I didn't want to directly call parts of the game's code where I could avoid it by sending click events.  At some point I gave up and decided to go hybrid.  This is a project just for fun.  If you want to use it and find a bug, drop me an email and I'll see what I can do.
