    <h1>Kittens code</h1>
    <p>
      There's this game called <a href="http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/#"> Kittens game.</a>  Yeah, this is code to automate that.  Why?  It seemed like fun to automate it.  It's single player only, so it doesn't matter.  It was good practice in javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      to use, hit ctrl shift I (command shift I on mac) or get into web dev tools somehow and paste this into the console there.  Read the script first if you're paranoid.

      oh, and hit the trade button first.  it's a bug I still haven't fixed.

    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>
      It was a hack that turned into fun.  
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>
      Auto crafting based on some maybe sensible defaults, some resource crafting controllable by menu.  Currently written to the titanium age, so no kerosene yet.
